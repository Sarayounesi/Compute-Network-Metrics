Network Metrics Computation
This repository contains solutions for Assignment #2, which involves collecting, computing metrics for, and analyzing various network datasets.

Assignment #2 Tasks

Collect Three Networks
•  Download Two Networks: Search for network datasets, ensuring one has at least 1000 nodes.

•  Prepare One Network: Create a network of known nodes and edges (e.g., cities, people, software, web-pages) with at least 10 nodes. This network should be prepared manually.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compute Metrics for These Networks
•  Number of Nodes

•  Number of Edges

•  Average Degree

•  Density

•  Clustering Coefficient 1

•  Clustering Coefficient 2

•  Diameter

•  Average Shortest Path Length

•  Plot Degree Distribution

•  Assortativity (Degree Correlation)

•  Top 5 Nodes Based on 3 Different Centrality Measures

•  Network Centralization
---------------------------------------------------
Analysis and Discussion
•  Analyze and discuss the results obtained from the metrics.

•  Highlight any interesting findings or patterns observed in the networks.
------------------------------------------
Repository Structure
•  /data: Contains the network datasets.

•  /scripts: Includes scripts for computing metrics and plotting distributions.

•  /results: Stores the computed metrics and analysis results.

•  README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.
